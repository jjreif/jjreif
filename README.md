### Jon Reifschneider ðŸ‘‹

I am a faculty member in Duke University's Pratt School of Engineering and run the [Master of Engineering in AI for Product Innovation](http://ai.meng.duke.edu) program there.

My current main activities:  
- I teach graduate-level courses in:  
  - [Intro to data science (AIPI 510)](https://github.com/AIPI510/aipi510_repo). 
  - [Intro to machine learning (AIPI 520)](https://github.com/AIPI520/aipi520_repo)
  - An advanced course in [deep learning applications (AIPI 540)](https://github.com/AIPI540/AIPI540-Deep-Learning-Applications).  
- And co-teach a summer program for undergrads (from anywhere) called the [Duke Summer Computing Institute](https://pratt.duke.edu/summer-computing-institute)
  
- I am the faculty member leading the [Duke Digital Venture Challenge](https://sites.duke.edu/digitalventurechallenge/), a tech entrepreneurship competition for Duke students

I've previously run large and small industry teams building ML-based products for industries including energy, transportation and agriculture.  I've also developed a [Coursera Specialization on AI Product Management](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/ai-product-management-duke) which provides a beginner-friendly, no-code introduction into machine learning and how to design and build ML-based products.
